I got mad??? Couldn't believe what I was seeing!
Seriously, be careful out there. These encounters are no joke.
This was genuinely one of the most terrifying encounters I’ve ever had filming with you. I’m so glad we all made it out safely.
This was truly scary, what was that creature with the big eye? Never seen anything like it.
That bird-looking thing does not like bright lights! Noticed how it recoiled?
Wow, that was absolutely mortifying. Scary AF. Those big eyes give me the creeps.
Holy hell, what a banger. Love the weird creatures you find.
Now THAT was scary!! Hope you're all dealing with this okay. Reach out if needed and stay safe.
Does anyone know what the bird-looking monster is?? It's like nothing I've ever seen.
I don't think it likes the flashlight! Maybe it's used to the dark?
The suspense before that big-eyed creature appeared was insane. Couldn't look away.
How do you even find these things? Every video is more terrifying than the last.
I had to watch with the lights on. That 'bird' is the stuff of nightmares.
My heart was racing the whole time. Can't imagine being there in person.
Are these creatures getting more bizarre? This one was particularly unnerving.
Stay safe, guys. These adventures are incredible, but I worry about what you're encountering.
That creature's eye... it's like it was looking right through the screen.
I appreciate the bravery it takes to explore these unknowns. Thanks for bringing us along.
Every video is a deep dive into the unknown. This one was especially chilling.
The way that creature moved was so unnatural. It's all I'm going to think about tonight.
Can't help but wonder what else is out there after seeing something like that.
Your encounters with these entities are fascinating. But please, don't take unnecessary risks.
That big-eyed monster is going to haunt me. How do you keep your cool?
Is it just me, or are these creatures becoming more aware of the camera? It seemed to react to the light instantly.
Incredible footage, as always. But seriously, take care. Some of these creatures seem dangerous.
The sound that creature made... it wasn't anything like a bird. More chilling, somehow.
The tension in the air just before that creature popped up was palpable even through the screen. Heart was in my throat!
How do you guys stay so calm? If I saw something with eyes like that staring back at me, I'd be frozen solid.
The bravery you all show by going into these situations is commendable. But seriously, be safe. That creature looked like it came from another dimension.
The exploration you do is next level, but encountering something like that big-eyed horror? Makes me glad I'm just a viewer.
Watching from the safety of home and still felt my skin crawl. Can only imagine the adrenaline rush in person. Stay cautious!
