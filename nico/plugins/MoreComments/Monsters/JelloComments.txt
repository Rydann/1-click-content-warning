That blob looks so cozy! Like a giant pillow, but better.
I want to jump in it! Imagine the slow-motion footage that would make.
I wonder if it's edible... Not that I'd try, but you know, just curious.
I want to touch it! It looks like it would feel amazing.
BLOB! BLOB! BLOB! Can we get more blob content, please?
The blob looks so squishy! It’s like nature’s stress ball.
I want to poke that blob! It seems like it would jiggle amusingly.
I think the blob is kinda innocent. Just blobbing around, doing blob things.
Was that an animal of some kind? Or just a mysterious blob creature?
I'm a new subscriber... I clicked just as the video started. Jello jello!
Yes, yes, yes, pal. You are a legend. As always, great vid.......
I have seen a photo of that one before! They call it the flicker monster.
Love your episodes. I can’t wait until your new ones come out!
Love it! The invisible monster is so cool! Your videos are great!!!!
This genuinely scared me... I was literally looking away!
Great capture!! Even filmed an invisible! But that blob stole the show for me.
The blob’s the real MVP here. So mesmerizing and oddly comforting.
Does the blob have a name? I feel like it deserves a cute one.
Imagine a world where blobs like this are pets. I'd adopt one in a heartbeat.
Every time I see something like this, I'm reminded of how strange and wonderful the world is.
Can you imagine stumbling upon this blob during a hike? Instant viral video material.
That blob has more charisma in one squish than I do in my entire body.
The texture looks so unique! Never seen anything quite like it.
If blobs could talk, I bet this one would have some stories to tell.
Absolutely entrancing. The way it moves and shifts is like watching a lava lamp.
This is why I love your channel. You find the most incredible things, like this blob!
