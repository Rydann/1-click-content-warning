I think <playername> died??? That was unexpected!
<playername> died? Can someone confirm what just happened?
Is <playername> okay!? That looked serious!
<playername> looks dead, wtf happened there?
OMG, did we just witness the end of <playername>?
No, no, no! <playername> can't be gone just like that!
Whoa, did anyone else see that? <playername> just bit the dust!
Is this game over for <playername>? That was brutal!
<playername>, please tell me you're just playing dead... right?
RIP <playername>. That was one harsh way to go out.
Yikes, <playername>'s last move didn't go as planned, huh?
<playername>'s demise was both shocking and sudden. What a twist!
Wait, is that it for <playername>? Say it isn't so!
This can't be happening... <playername> was doing so well!
Wait, <playername> has fallen? This can't be the end, can it?
The silence after <playername>'s fall was deafening. What now?
In a blink, <playername> was down. Still can't wrap my head around it.
That was a twist I didn't see coming. <playername>, you'll be missed!
It all happened so fast. Is <playername> really out of the game?
Surely, that's not the end for <playername>. They've got too much spirit to go out like that!
In disbelief here... <playername>, say it's just a dramatic pause!
<playername> down? I refuse to believe it. They always have a trick up their sleeve!
This has to be a plot twist. <playername> playing dead to come back stronger, right?
I'm not accepting this. <playername>'s story can't end here. They're a fighter!
Dead? No way. <playername> is about to pull off the greatest comeback, watch!
It's just a setback for a major comeback. <playername> doesn't do 'game over.'
